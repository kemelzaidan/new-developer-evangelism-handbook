## Work with your own company

As a developer evangelist you will find that a large part of your work is dealing with internal developers and unpredictable changes to your company.

This can actually be a much harder job than dealing with outside developers. The reason is that people on the inside do not only see the outcome of the products and disagree with that but are also part of the journey towards these - and that journey can be painful, frustrating and sometimes just plain confusing.

Your job as a developer evangelist is to listen to developers, understand their problems and communicate with management to try to sort the issues out. You also need to ensure that you remind people of facts instead of chiming in with bad rumours - what the outside world says about the company and products might not necessarily be the real picture.

> **Example:** It is pretty scary just how big a business company rumours is. Sites like [Valleywag](http://valleywag.com/), [Alley insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/alleyinsider) and lately sadly enough more and more [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/) are always on the lookout for a juicy story that rivals the celebrity rag mags. Proper investigation and separation of rumours and facts is not high on the list - what stirs emotions is what a successful news post is about.

There are a lot of things you have to be aware of when you are a developer evangelist. One of them is the enemy within the company.

## Prepare for prejudice

You have a very unique and new role which spans various traditional roles. Especially for developers moving away from the day to day grind can easily be seen as betraying the cause. Prejudiced developers are amazingly proud of being the delivering part of the company and consider anyone who does not code superfluous. I am sure you met these people and heard statements like “I don't know why we need designers, I know how to use Photoshop, too!”. It is somewhat ironic that the people whose standing in the company you try to improve are the ones that are likely to be opposed to your role.

In the end, this is something you will have to live with. You will burn a few bridges and you will have to suffer a lot of internal and external abuse and nagging but it is important to keep your eyes on the goal. If working for 12 years as a web developer has taught me one thing then it is that delivering awesome work pleases first and foremost yourself. In order to have an impact in the company and to get things changed you have to take your hands off the keyboard and start talking and persuading.

**Don't get discouraged by people seemingly stabbing you in the back** - in reality this is exactly the miscommunication and lack of people skills that you try to help out with. See it as a challenge and not as a show-stopper. Once you can show successes of improving the standing of developers in the company you can go back and call a comparison match. Most of the time this is not necessary any longer though as the terribly grumpy people either left the company or others start telling them to stop.
